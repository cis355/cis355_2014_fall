							<p>
								Hello! My name is Tyler Metiva and I am a Computer Science Major here at SVSU.
								I enjoy programming in the C/C++ programming languages and would like to 
								work in embedded development after I earn my degree.
							</p><hr>
							<p>
								I decided to create a watches table mainly because many other items
								that I was interested in selecting were already chosen by other students. 
								However, watches turned out to be a good choice due to the wide variety 
								of different attributes and prices available.
