		<p style="margin-left: 40px;">After this semester I will have 3 more semesters until I graduate. After graduation I hope to get a job where I can help develop front end design for webpages or GUIs for newly developed software. Making screens and user interaction forms easy to use and eye catching by utilizing white space is a passion of mine. Before I attending SVSU I went to ACC, a community college located in Alpena, MI. Before that I spent three and half years over in Sasebo, Japan while I served my active duty contact in the US Navy. </p>

		<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Deep Freezers are a great way to store large amounts of food that need to be frozen. Such items as beef, pork and chicken. Instead of buying meat products from a local store you can end up saving money if you find someone willing to sell you either a half or quarter of a beef or pork. The meat is usually cheaper and taste better since usually people that raise they own meat dont have them eatting things such as hormons. </p>
